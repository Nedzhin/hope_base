1,achalasia,"## Basic Information

Achalasia is a rare esophageal motility disorder characterized by the failure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to relax and by the absence of esophageal peristalsis.","## Mild Symptoms of Achalasia

### Difficulty Swallowing (Dysphagia)
In the early stages of achalasia, patients may experience mild difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), which tends to progressively worsen over time.","## Achalasia

Achalasia is a primary esophageal motility disorder characterized by the failure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to relax and the absence of normal esophageal peristalsis.","## Inspection

During the physical examination of a patient suspected to have otosclerosis, inspection is a critical component.","## Radiology

### X-ray
For achalasia, a barium swallow X-ray is a common radiological investigation.","## Wait and See

In the management of achalasia, a ""wait and see"" approach is typically not recommended due to the progressive nature of the disease.","## Prognosis of Achalasia

Achalasia is a chronic esophageal motility disorder characterized by the inability of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to relax.","## Question 1: Anatomy and Achalasia

Which anatomical structures are primarily involved in the pathophysiology of achalasia?","## Diagnosis and Investigation of Achalasia

### European Guidelines (ESGE)

The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) provides guidelines for the diagnosis and management of achalasia."
